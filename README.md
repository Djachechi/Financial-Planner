# Financial-Planner

![Planner ](https://github.com/Djachechi/Financial-Planning/blob/main/Images/financial-planner.png)

Created two financial analysis tools.

The first tool - A peronal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

The second tool - A retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. Used the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
